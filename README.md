*You may notice that  falcon heavy launch shows as falcon 9, but that appears to be due to the API. Doesn't appear like this now.

```
Usage:
    spacex-cli
    spacex-cli [-a <polling interval>] | [-h] | [-s <polling interval>] | [-d] | [-b] | [-v] | [-p <appdir>] | [-n <time remaining>] | [-g <time remaining>]
    spacex-cli [--api_refresh=<polling interval>] | [--help] | [--screen_refresh=<polling interval>] | [--dump] | [--blink] | [--archive] | [--path=<appdir>] | [--notify_time=<time remaining>] | [--highlight_time=<time remaining>]

Options:
    -h, --help              Show this help information.
    -s, --screen_refresh    Screen refresh interval in milliseconds. How often time-based information updates [default: 1000]
    -a, --api_refresh       API refresh interval in milliseconds. How often we poll the api for new/updated information. Please don't use small values! [default: 600000]
    -c, --color             Print with color [default: true]
    -d, --dump              Non-interactive mode - dumps the main launches table [default: false]
    -b, --blink             Blink for close launches. This argument exists because I know some people hate blink [default: false]
    -v, --archive           Archive launch data when changed [default: false]
    -p, --path              Application directory [default: ~/.spacexcli]
    -n, --notify_time       At this amount of seconds remaining until launch, send a notification [default: 5400]
    -g, --highlight_time    At this amount of seconds remaining until launch, highlight the row in the table view [default: 86400]
```
This is an enhanced version of a basic CLI bash script I was using.

Because the bash script was based on the v3 [spacexdata](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) api, I was forced to upgrade it to use the new v4 api. 

So I decided to not just upgrade the bash script to use the new api, but also add some new features and more interactibility. 

The cli isn't pretty like some others, but I think it's quite dense in relevant information.
